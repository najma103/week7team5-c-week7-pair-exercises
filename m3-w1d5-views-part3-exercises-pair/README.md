# Fly By Night Bank

the Fly By Night Banking home page, a list of your accounts, and a detailed transaction view for a particular account.

* **You need to use a Layout Page**. All pages must have a consistent look and feel with minimal duplicate code. 
    * We've provided you the initial `index.html` page with the three column layout. **Use that to help start developing your layout page.**
   
* One view lists all of the available bank accounts with their name, balance, and account number. The url for your view is `http://loocalhost/Home/BankListin`

# Movie Show Times

Using the concepts learned in today's class you will be developing a two page web application that displays
a listing of movies and available showtimes.

* **You need to use a Layout Page** for your application so that both pages have a consistent look and feel with
minimal duplicate layout code. You will also need to create two separate views.
    * A sample view (`index.cshtml`) file has been provided within your repository so that you and your partner can use it to extract common layout components.

* One view lists all of the available movies. The url for your view is `http://localhost/Home/MovieListing`
